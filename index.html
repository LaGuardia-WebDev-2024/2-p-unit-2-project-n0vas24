       Underhill Playground!!
      </h2>
      <small>Just a few blocks North of the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza, Underhill playground has two main play areas (one for one for the little guys and one for older kids) that are separated by sprinklers, and a single entrance, which makes it easy to keep kids safely inside. To the right in the back are baby swings, and to the far left is a little grassy area under the trees. There are also two open cement areas in front of the restrooms, down a few steps, where children often play with balls or ride bikes and toys around.
<br>
        <br>
This playground has two distinctive features that make it stand out from other playgrounds:
        <br>
1. The fountains, art sculptures, and mosaics that are the work of Julie Peppito. They can seem whimsical or creepy depending on your artistic inclination: Gigantic fish with pudgy hands as tails and a duck on their head, with a human figure embedded in the duck; house-like metal sculptures with human features; large eye mosaics on the front wall of the bathroom.
<br>
        2. The abandoned toys. Tons and tons of abandoned toys: Plastic bikes, excavators, toy houses, a spring horse, stuffed animals, cars, a scooter, push carts, etc... Most of these toys are broken, but the kids love them, and thanks to them your kid(s) will never get bored at this playground.
<br>
        <br>
This playground is well maintained, restrooms are open during normal hours, and the sprinklers have been on at all times during the summer months. Also, strategically located just a few blocks South is Gold Star Beer Counter, which is a great place for all beer lovers; after spending a few hours running after your kid(s) at this playground, you know you deserve a cold one.</small>
